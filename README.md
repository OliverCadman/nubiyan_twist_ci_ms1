# Features

![NavBar - Tablet and Laptop Screen Size and Up](nt-navbar-mobile-laptop.png)

Each page features a responsive navigation bar, with a clickable logo icon positioned on the left (featured on desktop and tablet screen sizes, and displayed in collapsible dropdown on mobile screen size). The font chosen for the navigation links is "Alatsi" from Google Fonts, and the color "Sinbad" (#9ad0c0) was chosen for the navbar's background. These design choices were made as they represent the styling used on the album cover for Nubiyan Twist's latest release 'Freedom Fables', and so reinforces brand recognition, and promotion of the band's latest album.

The Home, About and Contact Page feature a hero image at the top, covering almost the whole screen height and width. The images used for the hero image include black and white photographs of the band playing live, and cover art for the band's album releases.

Each page features a footer, with clickable links to the band's social media platforms (styled with FontAwesome icons). Icons of the band's label and booking agents are featured on large screen sizes, and are hidden on tablet and mobile screen sizes.

---

### Home Page

The home page features a hero image at the top; a black and white photograph of the band playing live, with an added kaleidescope effect. Sitting on top of the background image is the main header stating the name of the band, followed by a leading quote, included to reinforce trust in the quality of the band, and it's brand. The final feature of this section is a call-to-action button, inviting the user to 'Watch/Listen'. When clicked, this button will hyperlink to two feature videos further down the page. These features are included on all screen sizes, and their inclusion is intented to provide a visual impact to the user, and to provide an immediate recognition of the website's intention.

The second section promotes the band's latest release "Freedom Fables". A header is included, detailing that the latest release is available now, and above the header are FontAwesome icons that are linked to the relative streaming and downloading platforms. As well as  the FontAwesome icons, there are two call-to-action buttons; one is inviting the user to 'Download/Listen', and will take the user to the band's BandCamp page in a seperate window. The second invites the user to visit the website's shop, to purchase the record. A hover effect is added to both the FontAwesome links and the call-to-action buttons to provide visual feedback to the user. 

Below the header is a central image of the album art of "Freedom Fables" with quotes from notable music publications featured on the top and on both sides of the image.

At the end of the section are two feature videos of the band playing live, playing a selection of two songs from the latest release. The videos feature controls to provide the user the choice of playing the video, as opposed to autoplaying regardless of the user's wishes.  Below the videos is another call-to-action button, inviting the user to watch more videos. This button will take the user to the website's 'Video' page.

The final section features a call-to-action to join our mailing list (targetting a modal window), with the content outlining a promotional offer, in a bid to encourage further loyalty from the user to the band and their brand. Next in the section is an embedded spotify player featuring the band's latest release, accompanied with an image encouraging the user to "listen on spotify". This image is in the form of a badge on Desktop/Laptop and Tablet screen sizes, and collapses down to a full-width banner on mobile screen size. A fixed background was chosen for the section, displaying an image of the cover art of another of the band's latest single releases.

### About Page

Similarly to the Home Page, the top of the about page features another black and white photograph of one of the band's live shows. This is a wide angle shot of the band, from above, in an attempt to feature as many of the band's members as possible and encapsulate the presence of the band live on-stage. A testimony from a publication is featured in large font size (decreased to a smaller font size on tablet and mobile screen sizes). Below the testimony is a brief summary of the band and their ethos, positioned in darkest areas of the hero image, so as not to obstruct any band members or instruments, as best as possible.

The next section has a header included, with a dark background spanning the full width of the screen. Another incarnation of the band's logo is included in the header, to further reinforce brand recognition to the user (this feature is included in multiple sections of the website). Below the header features a comprehensive, detailed history of the band and it's catalogue of releases. Clickable images of their album art is featured when the relative album is mentioned through the history of the band. They are linked to bandcamp pages, which open in seperate tabs/windows. The clickable images are made from two squares; one slightly larger than the other, to create a border. These squares are layered with z-index, and upon hovering, the inner square increases in size, with the intention of providing a good visual feedback to the user. Between the first two images is a call-to-action "Click to Listen", to inform the user that the images are clickable.

The final section features the core members of the band, in the form of bootstrap cards. Each card features an image of the band member, their name and instrument, and a clickable button which opens a modal window detailing a brief summary of their role in the band, and details of their other projects. Each modal window features an embedded video of the relative band member's work, either with the band or in one of their other projects, and a button to close the window. Users may also close the modal by clicking the outside the window. Though JavaScript code isn't a requirement of this particular assessment and is not expected by the assessors, I deemed it necessary to apply basic JavaScript in order to stop the embedded video playing upon closing the modal window, so the user doesn't have to stop the video before closing the window, therefore providing a better user experience. I must stress in earnest that the JavaScript used was referenced from Stack Overflow.

### Live Shows
The Live Shows page begins with another header with background and brand logo. Directly below is an alert bar spanning the full screen, inviting the user to sign up to the mailing list, to keep up-to-date with the band's latest gig listings. This feature is hidden on mobile screen sizes.

Below is a table featuring the band's upcoming gig listings with dates, venues, and a FontAwesome Ticket Icon, linked to the relative online box-offices. The ticket icon smoothly changes colour and slightly increases in size upon hovering. A wide-angle image of the band playing to a large audience is featured to the right of the gig listings table, with a caption informing the user of the venue played, and year the image was captured. That particular image was chosen to capture the footfall that the band can bring into venues, so as to portray the reputation the band has in the live music industry. This image is displayed on laptop and tablet screen size, and is hidden on mobile screen sizes. Below the image is an embedded spotify player, included to encourage the user to preview the band before buying a ticket, or to simply enjoy the music while they browse upcoming gigs.

---

### Video
The video page is divided into two sections; Music Videos and Live Videos. Each section is headed with the characteristic style of dark background and brand logo, as seen in the About Page. The first videos in the collection are displayed immediately below the header upon opening the page, and appear two per row on laptop and desktop screen sizes, collapsing to a single column on tablet and mobile devices. Each video sits within a dark background and is given a bold white font clearly stating the song, and a lighter italicized font stating the guest artist featured in the song. In the 'Live Videos' section, the lighter italicized font is then applied only to the part of the header stating the venue where the performance was recorded. The videos are paused upon opening, and controls are provided for the user to play the videos at their will.

---

### Shop 
The shop page contains two sections, divided according to the category of product; 'Music Shop' and 'Clothing/Prints'. Each section beings again with a heading, styled characteristically with the dark background and brand logo. 

Displayed immediately below the headings are the products, contained within bootstrap cards. Each card features an image of the product, and a heading below stating the name of the product and the price. Below each heading is a button inviting the user to find out more information, with hover effect to provide visual feedback. Upon clicking, a modal window is opened, featuring an image of the product and the price, and a detailed summary of the product being offered. At the bottom of the modal window are two buttons; one inviting the user to add the product to their basket and another to close the modal window. Each button is again given hover styling, providing visual feedback. 

A small clickable window is featured at the top of the page, inviting the user to view their basket, along with a FontAwesome basket icon, to make more explicit the purpose of the feature. The window displays the quantity of products that are in their basket, and is given hover styling to inform the user that it is clickable. Upon clicking, a hidden window expands from the left hand side of the section displaying information about the product the user has chosen. The window expands to the full-width of the screen on mobile devices. Featured inside is an image of the product, the product's name, the price, a button to remove the product, and a total price of the products in the basket. Then the user is invited to close the window, or checkout. 

Upon clicking the checkout button, a modal window is opened, featuring a bootstrap form to allow the user to input their delivery and billing details, headed by the characteristically styled header. A checkbox is provided for the user to click if their billing address is the same as their delivery address. At the footer of the modal are two buttons, one to purchase the product(s), and another to close the window. 

A number of the features on this page rely on JavaScript in order to work smoothly as a complete entity; namely the small clickable basket information window, the collapsible 'Your Basket' window which opens when the Basket info button is clicked, and the 'Same as Billing Address' checkbox in the 'Checkout' form. Again I am aware of course that JavaScript code isn't a requirement of this assessment and is not expected by the assessors. However after deliberate consideration, I deemed it important to include, exclusively to fulfill the criteria for a smooth, intuitive user experience, as one of the chief business goals of the website is to of course, sell the band's products. The JavaScript I used is not my own; it was referenced from three sources:

### Contact Page
The contact page features a fixed background image of the band's cover art for one of their releases. Sitting on top is a bootstrap form with fields for the user to input their name and email address, a textarea for the user to ask any questions or make any comments, and a button for the user to submit their query. On either side of the form are the logos, and a clickable email address for the band's industry representatives, hyperlinked to the user's email platform. The email links smoothly change colour and increase in size slightly upon hovering, ro provide visual feedback. The representative's contact information collapses to sit below the form on mobile devices.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The two primary background colours used in the website are:

* (#9ad0c0) - This colour is a light, pastel shade of cyan, and was chosen based on it's association with the colour scheme used for the band's latest album release "Freedom Fables". Furthermore, the intention behind using this colour is to invoke a pleasant, positive emotional response from the site user. The colour is used as the background colour for both the navigation bar and the footer, on all pages. 

* (#dcb3ac) - This colour is a light, pastel shade of red, bordering on pink, and was chosen simply to complement the colour selected for the navigation bar and the footer. 


Font Colours include:

* Orange (#f48826) - This colour is used only for top-level headings, where the background is a black and white hero image. 

* Charcoal (rgb(70,70,70)) - This colour is used for the fontawesome icons used in the social media links on the Home Page. This colour was chosen to complement the light red (#db3ac) colour used as the relative section's background, and in turn provide accessibility in the form of colour contrast.

* Black - This colour is used also to ensure maximum accessibility and contrast against the relatively bright colours used for the backgrounds. This colour is also used when the site user hovers over any of the fontawesome social media icons.


# Testing 

## Testing fan/potential fan stories from UX section of README.md file

1. As a fan, I want to be able to easily navigate to and clearly view gig listings, so I can see if they are performing near me.
    1. As each page features a navigation bar with a bright background and dark, constrasting font colour, fans will be able to access a list of the band's live shows regardless of which page of the website they are viewing.

2. As a new fan, I want to be able to sign up to a mailing list, so I can keep updated about new releases and upcoming shows/tours.
    1. The home page features a call-to-action to sign up to the band's mailing list, which is placed specifically to contrast against the dark colour of the fixed background image. A FontAwesome icon is also used to provide visual feedback.


3. As a potential fan, I want to see footage of their live shows, so I can determine if it's worth spending money to see them live.
    1. The Home page features two embedded videos of the band playing live, positioned side by side on laptop/desktop and tablet screen sizes, and stacked vertically on mobile screen size. The videos are sized to be as large as possible, so as to draw attention to the user without crowding the section. The videos were placed strategically on the home page as the user is most likely to inspect this page first, upon visting the website for the first time.

4. As a fan, I want to view a biography, so I can find out more about the history of the band.
    1. The About Page features a detailed history of the band, and the font colour for this content chosen to contrast against the light red/pink background. 
    2. The About Page also features bootstrap cards for each member of the band, with an image, their name, role in the band, and a button opening a modal window with relative embedded videos featured. Custom CSS is implemented to smoothly scale the cards up a small amount when the user hovers the cursor over each card.
